  abstract = "Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is used to infer evolutionary
              history, to identify genomic regions under selection, and to
              dissect the relationship between genotype and phenotype. In each
              case, we require accurate estimates of LD statistics from
              sequencing data. Unphased data present a challenge because
              multilocus haplotypes cannot be inferred exactly. Widely used
              estimators for the common statistics r2 and D2 exhibit large and
              variable upward biases that complicate interpretation and
              comparison across cohorts. Here, we show how to find unbiased
              estimators for a wide range of two-locus statistics, including
              D2, for both single and multiple randomly mating populations.
              These unbiased statistics are particularly well suited to
              estimate effective population sizes from unlinked loci in small
              populations. We develop a simple inference pipeline and use it to
              refine estimates of recent effective population sizes of the
              threatened Channel Island Fox populations.",
